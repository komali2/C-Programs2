Assignment: "
How few? Well, you tell us. Write, in a file called greedy.c in your ~/Dropbox/pset1 directory, a program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then spits out the minimum number of coins with which said change can be made. Use GetFloat from the CS50 Library to get the user’s input and printf from the Standard I/O library to output your answer. Assume that the only coins available are quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢)."

Usage: ./greedy
	Input in decimal notation the amount of changed "owed."
	Output will be the number of coins returned.
